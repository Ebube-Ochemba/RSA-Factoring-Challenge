# RSA Factoring Challenge

> This project was on RSA factoring.

## Summary

I learnt about RSA, how HTTPS provide security, Prime Factorization and the significance of RSA.

## Requirements

- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files

> Each file contains the solution to a task in the project.

- [factors](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/RSA-Factoring-Challenge/blob/master/factors): An executable that factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.
> Usage:
```sh
$ factors <file>
```
Output format: `n=p*q`
	- one factorization per line
	- `p` and `q` (_might not be prime numbers, but are factors of_ `n`)

- [rsa](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/RSA-Factoring-Challenge/blob/master/rsa):

> - [factors.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/RSA-Factoring-Challenge/blob/master/factors.c): The source code for [factors](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/RSA-Factoring-Challenge/blob/master/factors).
> - [tests](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/RSA-Factoring-Challenge/blob/master/tests): A folder of test files. Provided by Alx.
